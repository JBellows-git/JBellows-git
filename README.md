- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m John Bellows. If you're looking at this then I likely applied to your company. Stay a while and take a look around, I hope you like what you see.

Most of these are very old projects that I haven't touched in a long time. They are not accurate representation of my current skills in coding.

Quick Overview:
-Homebrewer Project - Java
The Homebrewer Project is an Andriod app built in Java. The app helps beginner mead brewers with tracking their recipes and keeping notes on each batch they put together. The recipe builder has a built-in converter that will tell you the approximate initial sugar content of the recipe based on the amount of honey used.

-adventure-rpg-windowsforms
A personal project that I started in early December 2021. It's a Text-Based RPG using C#.NET Windows Forms. It wouldn't be a publishable game, merely a proof of concept for myself.
It uses two solutions: one for the UI and one for the game engine.

-adventure-rpg-asp
This project is similar to the Windows Form rpg except it is made with ASP.net using an MVC architectural pattern. It uses the Entity Framework 6 Code First approach to create a relational database that connects the various areas of the game, NPCs, enemies, loot tables, and more.
